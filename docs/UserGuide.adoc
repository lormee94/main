== Introduction

=== PDF++ ?

PDF++ is a desktop application that is meant for anyone who wants or needs a convenient tool that helps you manage all the documents in your computer.
This application can be used by both *Text Input (TI)* and a Graphical *User Interface (GUI)*
hence, both technical users and casual users can enjoy a comfortable experience using our program. All features provided by our application can be used via the *TI* and relevant feedback, based on your command, will be displayed in the Response Area of the application.

=== Proper Usage of PDF++
As PDF++ aims to replace your existing File Management System, all operations should be done
through the application. In order to ensure smooth user experience, you should not perform any
operation, such as removing, renaming or replacing, on the files that was previously added into
the application outside of the application.

Furthermore, due to the properties of the Operating Systems, no operation can be performed on the
files that are opened. Please ensure that your files are not opened before executing the command.

This File Management System plans to enhance your typical experience managing your documents and
it strives to be the last document manager you will ever need. It includes a multitude of
functions in elevating your PDF reading and management experience. There are many features offered by our application that you can refer to in the table of contents on the left side of this screen with many more to come! Are you fascinated by PDF++? What are you waiting for?
Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

CAUTION: Please ensure that you have the permissions to Read, Write and
Execute the files that you wish to manage through our application. Please use
a web search, like Google, to assist you in identifying if you possess the

able to carry out the actions specified by you.

WARNING: Please do not manipulate the files once you have added them to our
application. Unforeseen actions such as moving, renaming and others might result
in unexpected behaviour by the application. Our application is meant to replace
the need for you to perform these actions manually on your files yourselves.
