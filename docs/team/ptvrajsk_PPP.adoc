== Introduction

This document provides a detailed description to my contributions to
the several projects that I have been a part of over the years. +
My contributions will be substantiated with relevant technical application
and sources, if possible. +

== Project: PDF++

PDF++ is an application built on Java that acts as a document management system
that provides some advanced features that improves the quality of life of its
users. +
The application has a working Graphical User Interface (GUI), built upon the
JavaFX framework, that is supplemented with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
to accept more specific requests by the User. +
{nbsp} +
Although not built to its final form, it boasts a large feature set such as:

- Adding, Moving and Deleting Documents.
- Assigning Custom Tags to Documents.
- Filtering Documents by Custom Tags.
- Assigning Deadlines to Documents that provide a Visual Response to the User.
- Permanent Encryption and Decryption of Documents such that they require
set passwords to open even if accessed outside the application.
- Merging multiple documents into a single document.

=== Summary of Contributions

My Enhancements to the Project Consists of: +

* *User Interface (UI) Transformations*
** *What*: The UI is the main layer of PDF++ that interacts with the End-User
of our platform.
** *Justification*: The initial UI was insufficient in realising my vision
for our application. Hence through the use of the `FXML` Scripting Language and
`JavaFX` Library, I had reinvented the UI such that it would more accurately
support the application and all the additional features we had planned to add
to it.
** *Highlights*: The UI is fully compatible with the additional features of
PDF++ and would require minimal to no overhauls should any new aspects of the
application require upgrading.

* *Introduction of Deadline Feature*
** *What*: The Deadline feature is one of the core features that we had planned
to introduce in our application. It is a means for the target audience to
manage their documents along with their current schedules.
** *Justification*: Although the application was working well as a Document
Management System, analysis of the needs and wants of our target audience
was necessary. Following several informal discussions, a key feature that
many took interest in was the ability to set Deadlines to documents thus
allowing the application to assist in 'reminding' the User.
** *Highlights* The deadline feature required drastic changes to the existing
`storage` and `model` components as they were a key feature tied to each and
every document managed by our application. As such there was key attention
to the the parsing of the Deadline between components in out application. An
example of which would be the translation of the Deadline between the `Java`
and `Json` frameworks.

==== User Guide Contributions

===== User Interface

The UI had to include labels that displayed the Deadlines keyed in by the User
which had to reflect the duration to the due date by changing colours. The UI
also needed to have a default _Welcome Screen_ that served as a central
dashboard to the User. +
Furthermore, the dashboard had to be replaced with a details screen when the
User interacted with one of the Files in our application. +
These requirements meant that the UI had to heavily communicate with the
`logic` and `model` systems in the backend to produce the required behaviours. +
The relevant pull requests pertaining to this feature can be
referenced in the following _Github_ issue
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-4/main/issues/152[#152]. +
{nbsp} +
The scripted UI is attached below:

To illustrate to a new User, the UI also had to be broken down into digestible
chunks that could be easily comprehended by the user. As such the following
diagrams were also added to the Introductory paragraphs of the User Guide.

The information was further colour coded to ensure the simplicity of the
diagrammatical explanations.

===== Deadline

As for the Deadline, there were several aspects that had to be communicated to
the end user namely, the usage style of the feature, additional requirements,
definitions to the colour coded labels and so on. Hence the following excerpt
was inserted into the User Guide. +

=== Setting a deadline for the file : `deadline`

Set or remove a deadline for the a file, specified by the index of the file
that is next to the name of the file in the Files Section, highlighted
in green. +

A file's deadline is located under its name and has 4 colours to indicate the
amount of time you have before it is due. +

The colour Green, indicates that there is more `7` days till the deadline
is due, as shown below. +

image::UGDeadlineFar.png[width="300"]

The colour Orange, indicates that you have less than `7` days till it is due.
As shown below. +

image::UGDeadlineNear.png[width="300"]

The colour Red, indicates that you have reached or failed to complete the
task by the due date, as shown below +

image::UGDeadlineDue.png[width="300"]

The colour Blue indicates that you have completed the set task. +

image::UGDeadlineDone.png[width='300']

All deadlines are also displayed in the Deadlines Section of the application
highlighted by Red. +

Format: `deadline INDEX date/DATE` [To Set a Deadline] +
Format: `deadline INDEX done` [To Complete a Deadline] +
Format: `deadline INDEX remove` [To remove a Deadline] +

Examples:

* `deadline 1 date/20-02-2019` +
* `deadline 1 done` +
* `deadline 1 remove` +

==== Developer Guide Contributions

===== Deadline feature
For the deadline feature the following excerpt was inserted into the Developer
Guide.

'''
=== Deadline Feature
==== Current Implementation
The deadline feature is facilitated by both `DeadlineCommand` and
`DeadlineCommandParser`. This feature
allows you to set or remove deadlines of the PDF file specified
by you from PDF++.

The `Deadline` feature has the following syntax: `deadline <INDEX> <ACTION>`.

* `INDEX` refers to the index of the file in the list that you wish to perform
the `action` on.

* `ACTION` refers to the type of action that you wish to perform.
There are 3 actions that you can perform
** `date/<DATE>`
*** `date/` refers to command immediately following after this prefix is a date
*** `<DATE>` must be of `dd-mm-yyyy` format
*** Example of a valid date format: 15-03-2019

** `done` assigns the PDF file a `DONE` status

** `remove` assigns the PDF file a `REMOVE` status

[NOTE]
After a deadline has been added to the PDF file you specified, the date will be
colour coded according to a fixed criteria

==== Design Considerations
When designing the UI, there were several considerations that I had keep in
mind. These include ensuring that the there is sufficient but not a suffocating
amount of information presented to the User to ensure an optimal experience. +
{nbsp} +
As for the Deadline feature there were several considerations regarding the
input allowances to provide the user. For instance the need to ensure that
dates are valid, and no illegal characters are inserted such that a security
flaw is introduced into the system.
